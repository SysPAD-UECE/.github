## Data Protection System based on Encryptation and Anonymization Techniques
 Made by the Laboratory of Computer Networks and Security of Universidade Estadual do Ceará (LARCES/UECE).

### Proposal summary
Currently, many companies and government institutions tend to deploy online and cloud services in order to modernize their business models. However, these companies, government institutions and end users are subject to intrusion attempts and data leakage. Several cases of data leakage have occurred around the world. This reality of sensitive data circulating on the Internet led to a concern about the impact of exposing this personal data to unwanted entities, driving the creation of privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Law (LGPD - 13709/2018) in Brazil and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR - 2016/679) in Europe, among other laws existing or being created in countries such as Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. These laws have as their main objective to legitimize the guarantee of data protection, which are being provided by users and used by service providers, classifying then, the degree of sensitivity of the information referring to each individual where, the greater the impact of the exposure of given data, the greater its sensitivity. Within this context, this project aims to develop a system for data protection, effectively overcoming these mentioned aspects based on data anonymization techniques. Additionally, this solution will be integrated with a cloud computing environment, enabling higher capacity processing without burdening the computational resources of devices and local servers of companies and government institutions. This project presents an innovative solution with regard to data protection and privacy, as it will allow companies and government institutions to store and/or disclose data without violating the points listed by privacy laws, preventing, even if there are cases of data leakage, data, they suffer the sanctions provided for by law.

### Description Project
This project aims to study techniques and methodologies to propose a system for data protection based on cloud computing, to enable a higher capacity processing without encumbering the computational resources of devices and local servers of companies and government institutions. Thus, the objective is to develop a system for receiving data through a communication API, anonymization configuration considered adequate, protecting data through encryption and returning anonymized data to system users. Finally, the prototype was deployed in a cloud environment to carry out a robust experimental analysis.
